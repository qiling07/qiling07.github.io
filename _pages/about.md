I am currently a first-year PhD student majoring in Computer Science at Purdue University. Before I came to Purdue, I studied at University of Michigan (CS) and Shanghai Jiao Tong University (ECE).

<!-- My research interest mainly lies in computer systems and architecture. Currently, I am interested in computer security, with a focus on hardware security. I am also interested in compiler and CPU optimizations in large cloud computing systems. I want to contribute to more efficient and more secure computer architecture. -->
<!-- My research interests revolve around computer systems and architecture. Currently, I am deeply engaged in computer security, with a specific emphasis on hardware security. I'm also intrigued by compiler and CPU optimizations in large-scale cloud computing systems. I want to contribute to more efficient and secure computer architectures. -->
I want to make computer systems more eï¬€icient, reliable, and secure. Currently, my project focuses on
scalable isolation techniques, specifically identifying and addressing bottlenecks in isolation techniques to
enhance performance and scalability. Still, my interest spans many other fields in computer architecture
and operating systems.

I am advised by [Kazem Taram](https://mktrm.github.io/) and [Pedro Fonseca](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/pfonseca/). During my undergraduate, I was advised by [Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/), [Shuwen Deng](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~shuwen/#), and [Yibo Pi](https://yibopi.github.io).

**I am looking for a research intern position starting Summer 2025. Please reach out to me if you are looking for research interns.**

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in Computer Science at the University of Michigan ([UMich](https://cse.engin.umich.edu)). Before I transferred to UMich, I studied at Shanghai Jiao Tong University ([SJTU](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn)), majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering.

<!-- My research interest mainly lies in computer systems and architecture. Currently, I am interested in computer security, with a focus on hardware security.

My research interests revolve around computer systems and architecture. Currently, I am deeply engaged in computer security, with a specific emphasis on hardware security. I'm also intrigued by compiler and CPU optimizations in large-scale cloud computing systems. I want to contribute to more efficient and secure computer architectures.

I am advised by [Shuwen Deng](https://caslab.csl.yale.edu/~shuwen/#) and [Baris Kasikci](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~barisk/). I have also closely worked with [Yibo Pi](https://yibopi.github.io).

I am applying for PhD programs and expect to graduate in Summer 2024. Please reach out to me if you are looking for PhD students.

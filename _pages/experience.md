- Jan. 2023 - Aug. 2023  
  **EFESLAB, University of Michigan**  
  **Advisors: Shuwen Deng and Baris Kasikci**  
  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Evaluating and assessing speculative gadgets in various applications and linux kernel.</span>  
  - Identified one key limitation of all state-of-the-art speculative vulnerabilities detectors – lack of exploitability evaluation.  
  - Characterized the exploitability of vulnerabilities with two metrics.  
  - Developed an LLVM compiler pass which instrumented a program to allow for runtime measurement of all vulnerabilities’ exploitability.  
  - Reduced the false positive rates of state-of-the-art detectors by up to 53%.

- Aug. 2021 - Aug. 2022  
  **Network Measurement and System Lab, SJTU**  
  **Advisor: Yibo Pi**  
  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Towards find-grained, high-coverage Internet monitoring at scale.</span>  
  - Developed a latency measurement module based on the ultra-fast large-scale network scanning tool Zmap.  
  - Studied limitations of conventional Internet monitoring strategies in accuracy and coverage.  
  - Carried out large-scale experiments and proved the superiority of our proposed Internet monitoring strategy.

  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Evaluating and assessing speculative gadgets in various applications and linux kernel.</span>  
	– Identified one key limitation of all state-of-the-art speculative vulnerabilities detectors – lack of exploitability evaluation.  
	– Characterized the exploitability of vulnerabilities with two metrics.  
	– Developed an LLVM compiler pass which instrumented a program to allow for runtime measurement of all vulnerabilities’ exploitability.  
	– Reduced the false positive rates of state-of-the-art detectors by up to 53%.

  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Towards find-grained, high-coverage Internet monitoring at scale.</span>  
	– Developed a latency measurement module based on the ultra-fast large-scale network scanning tool Zmap.  
	– Studied limitations of conventional Internet monitoring strategies in accuracy and coverage.  
	– Carried out large-scale experiments and proved the superiority of our proposed Internet moni-
	toring strategy.

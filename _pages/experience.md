- Research Assistant, Aug. 2024 - Present  
  **SecArch & RSSys, Purdue University**  
  **Advisors: Kazem Taram and Pedro Fonseca**  
  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Microarchitectural isolation for performance and security.</span>  
  - Identified a new kind of cache contention in serverless computing.
  - Discovered a new cache partitioning technique, without introducing new hardware.
  - Achieved fine-grained, zero-cost cache partitioning across tens to hundreds of serverless functions.
  - Improved the P50 latency of latency-critical functions by 30% on average.


- Research Assistant, Jan. 2023 - Aug. 2023  
  **EFESLAB, University of Michigan**  
  **Advisors: Baris Kasikci and Shuwen Deng**  
  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Evaluating and assessing speculative gadgets in various applications and linux kernel.</span>  
  - Identified the Timing Condition of Spectre-PHT gadget.
  - Presented a systematic study and exploration of windowing power. 
  - Proposed and implemented a new approach, which describes the timing condition with a DAG graph, models the windowing power with graph algorithms, and quantifies the gadgetâ€™s exploitability with runtime measurement.
  - Validated our approach and evaluated it against SOTA scanners on 2 micro-benchmarks, 6 userspace programs, and the Linux kernel. Identify 503 gadgets reported by SOTA scanners as unexploitable.


- Research Assistant, Aug. 2021 - Aug. 2022  
  **Network Measurement and System Lab, SJTU**  
  **Advisor: Yibo Pi**  
  <span style="color: gray; font-weight: bold;">Optimizing the accuracy and coverage of large-scale network monitoring.</span>  
  - Challenged two root assumptions of conventional network monitoring practice with experiments.  
  - Proposed and implemented a greedy end-to-end network monitoring approach.  
  - Evaluated the accuracy, coverage and overhead of our approach.
